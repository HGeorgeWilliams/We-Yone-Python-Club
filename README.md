# We-Yone-Python-Club
"We Yone" is a Krio phrase meaning "Our". I started We Yone Python Club in May 2020, to help young Sierra Leonean professionals (mostly engineers) learn Python programming during the COVID-19 lockdown. We meet online every Saturday and recordings, as well as code from these sessions will be deposited in this repository. Learn more about the Krio language and Sierra Leone by following this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krio_language.
