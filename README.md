# We-Yone-Python-Club
"We Yone" is a Krio phrase meaning "Ours". I started We Yone Python Club in May 2020, to help young Sierra Leonean professionals (mostly engineers) learn Python programming during the COVID-19 lockdown. We meet online every Saturday - recordings and code from these sessions will be deposited in this repository. Learn more about the Krio language and Sierra Leone by following this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krio_language.
